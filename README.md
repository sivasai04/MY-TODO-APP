# Full-Stack React To-Do List Application

This repository contains a complete, full-stack to-do list application. It features a responsive frontend built with React and a robust backend powered by Node.js and Express.

The application allows users to manage their tasks seamlessly, with all data being persistent. Changes are saved and retrieved from a local JSON file on the server, ensuring that your task list is preserved across browser sessions.

---
## TECH STACK USED

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- JavaScript : For the core application logic.

- CSS3: For custom styling, layout, and responsiveness.

- HTML5: For the application's semantic structure.

## Core Functionalities

This application implements full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations:

* **Create:** Add new tasks to your list through an intuitive input form.

* **Update:** Edit the text of any existing task.

* **Delete:** Remove completed or unwanted tasks from the list.

* **Data Persistence:** All tasks are saved on the server, so your list is always up-to-date, even after closing the browser or restarting the computer.

        -   **Open Backend Folder:**

            - that is cd backend

            - npm install (this will install the dependencies).

            - node server.js (this will start the server).

    -   **open another terminal**

        - **open frontend folder**

            - that is cd frontend

            - npm install (this will install the dependencies).

            - npm start (this will launch the interface).
